# PF2-Kill-Alerts
Kill alerts, intended for usage in Pre-Fortress 2.

Fixes telefrag not working.

Plan to add additional functionality to do alerts for other damage like goomba stomp. 

SMX files requires SM 1.12

INC file is included, as I had an error when compiling because of the way demoman and heavy were defined.
